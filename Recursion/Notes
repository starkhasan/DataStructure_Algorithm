What is Recursion

The Process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called
recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily.

what is base condition in recursion?
There must be atleast one base criteria or condition, such that when this conditionis is
met the function stop calling itself recursively. Progressive approach The recursive
calls should progress in such a way that each time a recursive 
call is made it comes closer to the base criteria.


why Stack Overflow error occurs in Recursion?
If the base case is not reached or not define, then the tack overflow problem 
may arise.


What is the difference between direct and indirect recursion?

A function fun is called direct resursive if it calls the same function fun.
A function fun is calledindirect resursive if it calls another function say fun_new
and fun_new calls fun directly or indirectly.



How memory is allocated to different function calls in recursion?
When any function is called from main() the memory is allocated to it on the
stack. A recursive function calls it self, the memory for a called function 
is allocated on top of memory allocated to calling function and the different copy
of local variables is created for rach function call. When the base case is reached
the function returns its value to the function by whom it is called meomory if deallocated 
and the proves continues.
